Search::GIN::Extract::AttributeIndexes

This module is an extension for the "Search::GIN" search and index
framework which allows one to operate objects of any class consuming
"MooseX::AttributeIndexes", and extracting values from those objects for
use in indexing.

This allows people to define how an object should be indexed on the
class definition itself by adding properties to attributes.
